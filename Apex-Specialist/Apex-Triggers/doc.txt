Trigger are two different types-
 1. Before Triggers are used to update or validate record values before they are saved to database.
 2. After Triggers are used to access the field values that are set by the system.( records ID,LastModifiedDate). the records that fire after triggers are read only.



Using Context Variable

to access the recors that caused the trigger to fire , use context variables.
Trigger.new - it contains all the records that were inserted in insert or update triggers.
Trigger.old - provieds old version of sObjects before they were updated in update triggers.

Some other context variables return a Boolean value to indicate whether the trigger was fired due to an update or some other event. These variables are useful when a trigger combines multiple events. For example:



trigger ContextExampleTrigger on Account (before insert, after insert, after delete) {
    if (Trigger.isInsert) {
        if (Trigger.isBefore) {
            // Process before insert
        } else if (Trigger.isAfter) {
            // Process after insert
        }
    }
    else if (Trigger.isDelete) {
        // Process after delete
    }
}


isExecuting - Returns true if the current context for the Apex code is a trigger, not a Visualforce page, a Web service, or an executeanonymous() API call.
isInsert - Returns true if this trigger was fired due to an insert operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API.
isUpdate - Returns true if this trigger was fired due to an update operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API.
isDelete - Returns true if this trigger was fired due to an delete operation, from the Salesforce user interface, Apex, or the API.
isBefore - Returns true if this trigger was fired before any record was saved.
isAfter - Returns true if this trigger was fired after all records were saved.
isUndelete
new -  Returns a list of the new versions of the sObject records.
      This sObject list is only available in insert, update, and undelete triggers, and the records can only be modified in before triggers.
newMap
old - eturns a list of the old versions of the sObject records.
      This sObject list is only available in update and delete triggers.
oldMap
